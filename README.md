An implementation of an SVM that can classify exoplanets as biotic or abiotic based on inferred abundances of molecules from observations. 

SVMclass.py is the main implementation. svm_data.py provides functions for importing data from [rfast](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ascl.soft06028R/abstract) retrievals, but can be adapted to use MCMC retrievals from other codes. exmple.ipynb demonstrates usage of all of the functions. requirements.txt lists the package versions that were used when this code was written.
